	/**
	 * This is an example of a input stage that uses the low level API.  This is the most difficult to use API for 
	 * the ring buffer but it is generally the fastest and in some corner case becomes the simplest.
	 * 
	 * When should I use the low level API?
	 *           * When you are only using simple messages (no nested structure, can be done but takes work)
	 *           * When you only have 1 message ( or very few message types)
	 *           * When the template XML is never expected to change (without a recompile of the code)
	 *           * When building schema agnostic stages for general use
	 *        
	 * 
	 * What are the significant features of the low level API?
	 *           * Fields are all written in hard coded order with hard coded types
	 *           * No fields are skipped when using the API, every field must be written or read.
	 *           * If the consumer is far ahead the check for room does not need to update from tail position
	 *           * Writes can be batched to release larger blocks to the consumer for fewer head position updates
	 *           * ASCII, UTF8 and Bytes can be accumulated on the buffer followed by a single total on the primary ring.
	 *               (see the implementation of addASCII, addUTF8 for this)
	 * 
	 *
